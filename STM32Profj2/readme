#ball acceleration simulation

on STM32. using sh1106 & rotary encoder.


**stratege used to draw the ball on sh1106..**
the ball was 8x8 matirx. 
row can be continuously transferred to sh1106, but page(column) is discrete..
So, each column of the ball was shifted according to the position..




**movement of the ball**
ball should accelerate in the direction of encoder, and bounce when facing wall...
